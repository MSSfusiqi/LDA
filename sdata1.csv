"In 2013, one artist had their name legally changed to American Artist. “I was very interested in reframing the definition of an American artist,” that artist, who uses the last name Artist and prefers they/them pronouns, said. “If I make that my name, now I am it.” Completing the name change involved visiting a California court, publishing an official notice in a newspaper (“I chose the cheapest one,” they said), and setting up a hearing. No officials raised any objections.
Artist was messing with the stereotypes that attach to the phrase “American artist,” which calls to mind, for some, famous white men living in New York during the postwar era, like Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. What would it mean for a black individual, like Artist, to adopt the title? Recalling the name-change process recently, Artist said, with a laugh, “I am American Artist now, so I guess that’s what an American artist is.”
Though their name-change isn’t a work per se, it is an example of Artist’s sly, slippery practice, which has taken the form of digital works, videos, and sculptures that take on the shifting nature of identity in the internet age. (It’s worth noting that Googling American Artist is a Sisyphean task.) Often, Artist draws out connections between systemic forms of racism and new technological developments—one body of work, for example, addressed the whiteness of new products put out by Silicon Valley by simultaneously thinking through the look of iPhones and the racial demographics of technology companies. “I’ve started to think about anti-blackness as being sort of algorithmic, in that it’s embedded in the firmware of American society,” they said. “It’s a constantly reproducing and evolving thing, and it’s always doing what it’s supposed to do.”

"Using electrodes and artificial intelligence, scientists in California have built a device that can translate brain signals into speech. They say their experimental decoder could lead ultimately to a brain implant that restores the ability to speak to people who have lost it as a result of stroke, traumatic brain injury or neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.
“This is an exhilarating proof of principle that with technology that is already within reach, we should be able to build a device that is clinically viable in patients with speech loss,” Edward Chang, a professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and the senior author of a paper describing the technology, said in a statement.

For their research, Chang and his collaborators recorded the brain activity of five epilepsy patients (who already had brain implants as part of their treatment) as they read aloud a list of sentences. Then a pair of neural networks — artificial intelligence algorithms specially designed for pattern recognition — began the decoding process. They first used the brain signals to predict the instructions being sent to the lips, tongue, jaw and throat to produce the words. The second turned the predicted movements into synthesized speech produced by a computer.

"Officials in the California city where police fatally shot a young rapper inside his car in February are now asking the Department of Justice to step in and help improve relations between officers and the public.
""Having strength is knowing when to ask for help and that time is now,"" Vallejo Mayor Bob Sampayan said in a statement Friday. ""I welcome the wisdom and insights of the DOJ Community Relations Service to improve our police department and assist in elevating the level of community engagement with our residents.""

The call for federal intervention comes after a tense City Council meeting this week that focused on issues of policing, particularly within the city's minority community, and a report this month by NBC News that highlighted complaints of alleged aggressive policing and the police-involved shooting of black rapper Willie McCoy as the 16th death involving Vallejo police officers since 2011.
The majority of those killed by the police in Vallejo have been black and Latino men, police records show. The Bay Area city, with a population of 122,000, remains evenly divided among white, black, Latino and Asian residents.
In San Francisco, with a population more than seven times Vallejo's, the police department has been involved in 22 fatal shootings since 2011.

"“It seems if there was a time that industrial production and GDP would match up well it would be at time when there’s a relatively large inventory build,” he said. “When you unwind inventory, you would expect to see production slow.”
LaVorgna is forecasting 1% for first quarter GDP growth, reported April 26, but he said it could be even closer to flat. He added economists’ consensus forecast is 2%.

“To me the production data suggests there’s may more downside risk to Q1 than people currently believe,” he said.
Goldman Sachs economists said they were upping their first quarter tracking forecast to 1.7% because they had been expecting even weaker industrial production.
“We still expect real GDP output in the first quarter to hit 1.5%, but much of the increase will come from a temporary build-up of inventories rather than factories producing more goods,” noted Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG.

"The second round of the postseason has brought a new level of basketball. On the bottom half of the Eastern Conference bracket, the Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic are gone, leaving two teams playing at a much higher level.
And in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals series between the Toronto Raptors and the Philadelphia 76ers, none of the Sixers' stars could come close to matching the level of basketball played by Kawhi Leonard, who led the Raptors to a 108-95 victory with a dominant, 45-point performance on Saturday.
Leonard had more field goal attempts (23) than passes (19). And with 11 free throw attempts added in, there's no doubt that he was calling his own number most of the night. But when a guy shoots 16-for-23 from the field and 10-for-11 from the line, the only objection can come from the opponent.
""I don't think we showed enough help,"" said Sixers guard Ben Simmons.

"Apple is facing further scrutiny over whether it's using its hold on the App Store to hurt competitors' products.
A Saturday report in The New York Times says that in the past year, Apple has targeted 11 of the 17 most downloaded third-party apps designed to help phone users limit screen time or oversee their children's phone use. Apple either removed the apps from the App Store outright or restricted them in some way, the Times says.
The iPhone maker introduced its own screen-time and parental-controls features last June, when it unveiled iOS 12, the most recent major update to Apple's mobile operating system. On Friday, CEO Tim Cook discussed screen addiction at the Time 100 Summit in New York.
The Times report says the makers of two of the App Store's most popular parental control apps filed a complaint Thursday with the European Union's competition office, with one saying Apple compelled it to alter its app in ways that made it less effective than Apple's parental controls.

"President Donald Trump said on Saturday night that the United States is now sending undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities.
""Now we're sending many of them to sanctuary cities, thank you very much,"" he told a crowd in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""They ain't too happy about it. I'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea.""
On Friday in a speech to the National Rifle Association, he said the US is ""forced to release"" undocumented migrants into the country and that ""we give them (sanctuary cities) as many as they can handle.""
The Department of Homeland Security has not announced it is sending migrants to sanctuary cities.

The administration initially denied that the plan was under active consideration. After reports surfaced in the press where DHS officials said the plan had been scrapped, the President tweeted saying he was considering it.

"The U.S. economy grew at a faster pace than expected in the first quarter and posted its best growth to start a year in four years.
First-quarter gross domestic product expanded by 3.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday in its initial read of the economy for that period. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected growth of 2.5%. It was the first time since 2015 that first-quarter GDP topped 3%.

“The upside beat was helped by net trade (exports jumped while imports contracted sharply) and inventories which combined contributed almost 170 bps of the rise,” wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Personal spending though, the biggest component was up just 1.2%, two tenths more than expected as an increase in spending on services and nondurable goods offset a decline in spending on durable goods.”

"A recent court case in London over a painting—Portrait of a Man—bearing Frans Hals’s signature has put Sotheby’s in the unusual position of retrospectively trying to prove that there were doubts over the authenticity of the painting when the auction house brokered the sale eight years ago.
The two-week hearing—which started on 1 April under Mr Justice Knowles— between Sotheby’s and Fairlight Arts Ventures also called into question the definition of a scholarly attribution and the independence of scientific testing.
In 2011, Sotheby’s negotiated the private sale of the painting to the US collector Richard Hedreen. Five years later, when suspicions were raised over whether it was genuine, Sotheby’s suggested to Hedreen that the work should be tested by the Massachusetts-based laboratory Orion Analytical (which was subsequently bought by the auction house). Those tests concluded it was “a modern fake” and, consequently, Sotheby’s repaid the Seattle property developer the full $11.2m purchase price.

"With investors betting Tesla will soon raise capital, the stock fell 14% for the week to its lowest since January 2017, before the launch of the Model 3 sedan aimed at making the electric car maker profitable.
It was the worst weekly drop for Tesla since August last year, when Musk told the New York Times in a tearful interview that he was under major emotional stress.
In the options market, Tesla contracts changed hands at twice the usual pace, with sentiment leaning toward defensive bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
Tesla’s $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42%, more than 3 percentage points above the bond’s coupon rate of 5.3%. Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points.

One positive development for Tesla: a U.S. District Court judge on Friday granted a request by Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission for a second extension to resolve a dispute over Musk’s use of Twitter.
On Wednesday, Tesla posted a worse-than-expected loss of $702 million for the March quarter. Musk said Tesla would return to profit in the third quarter and that there was “some merit” to raising capital.

"Stephen Moore, during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” said there were a handful of reporters dedicated to digging up negative information on his personal life and previous statements.
Trump has not formally nominated Moore to be a Fed governor, which would give him a role in setting interest rates for the world’s biggest economy.
Moore said the Republican president asked him to appear on the Sunday news show, where he denounced negative news reports as a “smear campaign” and “character assassination.”
Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, giving them the final say on whether Moore’s promised nomination is confirmed. Democratic Senators have criticized Moore for his policy positions, including his longtime support of tax cuts to stimulate the economy, as well as his comments about women.
“If I become a liability to any of these senators, I would withdraw,” Moore told ABC. “I don’t think it’s going to come to that. I think most fair-minded people think this has been kind of a sleaze campaign against me.

“I just think the perception is very different from the reality in terms of my attitude toward women.”

"Stronger economic data recently signals a continuation of the 3% GDP growth rate, Kevin Hassett, an economic advisor to President Donald Trump, said Monday on CNBC.
“The first quarter is usually a little bit low. I think there’s almost more upside than downside risk going forward on the economy,” said Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. “Our internal numbers at CEA got up to around 3% for the first quarter last week with some of the good news on retail sales.”

The Trump White House has used 3% growth as a yardstick for success of the president’s economic agenda, which included tax cuts and business deregulation. The economy nudged past that number when measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 through Q4 of 2018.
Last week, economists surveyed by CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update raised their first-quarter growth estimates by 0.3 percentage point to a median 2.4%, following a sharp increase in March retail sales. Their median forecast for Q1 was as low as 1% earlier in the quarter after the longest government shutdown ever. Sentiment was also muted coming into 2019 after stocks suffered their worst year in about a decade.

"U.S. retail sales surged in March at the fastest pace since late 2017, as spending on autos, gasoline, furniture, and clothing jumped.
The Commerce Department said that sales increased a seasonally adjusted 1.6% from February, the strongest increase since September 2017.

The gains mark a sharp rebound from a lackluster period of sales dating back to December. It’s a sign that the healthy job market has likely made consumers more eager to spend in ways that boost overall economic growth.
Sales at gas stations climbed 3.5% in March, while spending at auto dealers jumped 3.1%. Clothiers reported a 2% gain and furniture stores enjoyed a 1.7% bump.
Excluding autos and gas, retail sales increased by a still solid 0.9%.
During the past year, retail spending has grown 3.6%.

"The U.S. goods and services deficit with its global trading partners fell to $49.4 billion in February, its lowest level since June 2018 and well below estimates, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected the U.S. trade deficit in February to increase to $53.8 billion from $51.1 billion in January.

The decline was due in large part to a 28.2 percent decrease in its goods deficit with China as exports to the nation surged. Exports to China rose $1.6 billion to $9.2 billion while imports fell $1.5 billion to $39.3 billion. That brought the total deficit with China to $30.1 billion.
The report helped boost the view of Wall Street economists on first-quarter GDP growht, which now likely will come in above 2 percent.
Overall, exports for the month rose $2.3 billion to $209.7 billion, while imports increased $600 million to $259.1 billion.
On a year-to-date basis, the goods and services deficit fell 7.6 percent, or $8.3 billion, from the same period in 2018. Exports rose $11.1 billion, or 2.7 percent, while imports increased $2.8 billion, or 0.5 percent.

"The artist Bob and Roberta Smith has submitted a work to the Royal Academy’s Summer Show (10 June-12 August) criticising Hertfordshire County Council’s decision to consign more than 450 works from its collection to auction.
The works are drawn from the Hertfordshire Schools Art Loan Collection—launched in the 1940s and comprising 1,496 works—which enabled children across the region to access works of art. The first auction of works from the collection of the Hertfordshire County Council, which was held on 21 March at Cheffins in Cambridge, raised more than £444,000 in total. A second auction took place yesterday at Cheffins; the auction house has not released details of the sale.

"As the gallery landscape undergoes considerable remodelling, most art fairs are adapting too, allowing unorthodox exhibitors with no fixed abode and no regular programme to participate.
Art Brussels has come up with its own solution this year: the creation of a new section, dubbed Invited, dedicated to nine galleries that are challenging the traditional gallery model, including pop-ups, collaborations and nomadic operations.
The key, says the fair’s managing director Anne Vierstraete, was to invite the galleries, rather than getting them to apply via the usual process and approved by the selection committee. The new section came together just a few weeks before the fair opened on Thursday (until 28 April).
The impetus partly came from Vierstraete’s desire to make Art Brussels more “daring and cutting edge”, and partly to boost the struggling middle and lower tiers of the market. Prices of booths in the Invited section are half of that in Discovery, which supports emerging artists.
However, some dealers have questioned the thinking behind the new initiative. “I was invited the day before [Art Brussels] sent out the list of fair participants, so what does that mean? Do they not really care about this section? Weren’t they ready with their product?” asks the Antwerp-based dealer Simon Delobel, who adapts the nature of his gallery to each artist he exhibits.
Delobel’s booth, which he considers a gallery, is titled Paid by the Artistbecause his artist, Yannick Ganseman, stumped up the €4,000 participation fee. “When Art Brussels called me I had a cash flow problem, I couldn’t pay immediately and Yannick offered to finance the project,” he says.

"President Donald Trump defended his equivocating comments following white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, saying Friday that he was referring to supporters of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee when he said there were ""fine people"" on both sides.
""I have answered that question, and if you look at what I said, you will see that question was answered perfectly,"" Trump said Friday at the White House.
He was making the comments a day after former Vice President Joe Biden used the episode as the opening salvo of his presidential campaign.

""Carl and I will attend Wednesday voluntarily, as we have offered from the beginning. I hope the session is productive,"" Robert Driscoll, Kline's attorney, said in a statement.
Kline's testimony has been of high interest for Democrats after a career White House official told committee investigators that Kline greenlighted security clearances for White House officials despite red flags raised in the vetting process.

"entire reason that the Galaxy Fold exists is because of the screen. Unlike other phones, where screens are an afterthought to camera quality and battery life, Samsungdesigned the entire phone around the fact that its display bends in half.
